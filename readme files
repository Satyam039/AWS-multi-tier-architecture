Part 1: Networking and Security
In this section we will be building out the VPC networking components as well as security groups that will add a layer of protection around our EC2 instances, Aurora databases, and Elastic Load Balancers.

Learning Objectives:
Create an isolated network with the following components:
VPC
Subnets
Route Tables
Internet Gateway
NAT gateway
Security Groups

Part 2: Database Deployment
This section of the workshop will walk you through deploying the database layer of the three tier architecture.

Learning Objectives:
Deploy Database Layer
Subnet Groups
Multi-AZ Database

Part 3: App Tier Instance Deployment
In this section of our workshop we will create an EC2 instance for our app layer and make all necessary software configurations so that the app can run. The app layer consists of a Node.js application that will run on port 4000. We will also configure our database with some data and tables.

Learning Objectives:
Create App Tier Instance
Configure Software Stack
Configure Database Schema
Test DB connectivity

Part 4: Internal Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
In this section of the workshop we will create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of the app tier instance we just created, and use that to set up autoscaling with a load balancer in order to make this tier highly available.

Learning Objectives:
Create an AMI of our App Tier
Create a Launch Template
Configure Autoscaling
Deploy Internal Load Balancer

Part 5: Web Tier Instance Deployment
In this section we will deploy an EC2 instance for the web tier and make all necessary software configurations for the NGINX web server and React.js website.

Learning Objectives
Update NGINX Configuration Files
Create Web Tier Instance
Configure Software Stack


Part 6: External Load Balancer and Auto Scaling
In this section of the workshop we will create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of the web tier instance we just created, and use that to set up autoscaling with an external facing load balancer in order to make this tier highly available.

Learning Objectives:
Create an AMI of our Web Tier
Create a Launch Template
Configure Auto Scaling
Deploy External Load Balancer
